# Bot trading gold

This is a proof of concept for an AI-powered hedge fund.  The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI to make trading decisions.  This project is for **educational** purposes only and is not intended for real trading or investment.

This system employs several agents which can be put to work together or separate:

1. Valuation Agent - Calculates the intrinsic value of a stock and generates trading signals
2. Sentiment Agent - Analyzes market sentiment and generates trading signals
3. Fundamentals Agent - Analyzes fundamental data and generates trading signals
4. Technicals Agent - Analyzes technical indicators and generates trading signals
5. Risk Manager - Calculates risk metrics and sets position limits
6. Portfolio Manager - Makes final trading decisions and generates orders

And there is also machine learning part which will learn each time the bot make a trade and saved it into rl_model.zip.

**Note**: the system simulates trading decisions, it does not actually trade.

## Setup

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mememaster699669/bot-gold-VHL.git
cd bot-gold-VHL
```

1. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Set your API keys:
```bash
# For running LLMs hosted by openai (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.)
# Get your OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# For running LLMs hosted by groq (deepseek, llama3, etc.)
# Get your Groq API key from https://groq.com/
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key

# For getting financial data to power the hedge fund
# Get your Financial Datasets API key from https://financialdatasets.ai/
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

**Important**: You must set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the hedge fund to work.  If you want to use LLMs from all providers, you will need to set all API keys.

Financial data for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA is free and does not require an API key.

For any other ticker, you will need to set the `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY` in the .env file.

## Usage

### Running the bot
```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --polling 60
```
